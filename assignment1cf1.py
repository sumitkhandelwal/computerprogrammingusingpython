# To find kinetic energy of an Object
# Input
mass = input("Enter the mass of an object :")
velocity = input("Enter the velocity of an object ")
# Calculation
KE = float(1)/2 * mass * velocity ** 2
# Output
print "The Kinectic energy of an Object is :",KE," Joule"
# Result
#Enter the mass of an object :45.65
#Enter the velocity of an object 65.7
#The Kinectic energy of an Object is : 98523.88425  Joule
