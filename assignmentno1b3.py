# Find the result of all the arithmetic operations
# (Addition, Subtraction, Multiply, Division and modulo) in Python.

# Take any two number from user using input function.

# Perform Arithmatic Operation
add = num1 + num2
sub = num1 - num2

print "Division of Two number is :", div
print "Modulo of Two number is :", modulo

#Output

# Enter first number : 10
# Enter second number : 20
# Addition of Two number is : 30
# Substraction of Two number is : -10
# Multiplication of Two number is : 200
# Division of Two number is : 0.5
Modulo of Two number is : 10
